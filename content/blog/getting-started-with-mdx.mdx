# Getting Started with MDX

MDX is a format that lets you use JSX in Markdown content. It's a great way to create interactive content in your blog posts.

## What is MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. This allows you to:

- Write content in Markdown
- Use JSX for interactive elements
- Import and use React components
- Add custom components to your posts

## Basic MDX Syntax

### Markdown Works as Expected

You can use all standard Markdown syntax:

**Bold**, *italic*, and `inline code` all work perfectly.

### Lists

Ordered and unordered lists are supported:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Unordered item
- Another item
  - Nested item

### Code Blocks with Syntax Highlighting

MDX supports code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

print(fibonacci(10))
```

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function createUser(user: User): User {
  return { ...user, id: Date.now() };
}
```

## Using JSX in MDX

One of the most powerful features of MDX is the ability to use JSX directly in your content:

```jsx
<div className="my-component">
  <h3>This is a JSX element</h3>
  <p>You can use any React component here!</p>
</div>
```

## Tips for Writing MDX Content

1. **Keep it simple** - Use Markdown for structure, JSX for interactivity
2. **Test your code** - Make sure code blocks render correctly
3. **Use proper formatting** - Consistent spacing and indentation
4. **Add metadata** - Always include frontmatter with title, date, and tags

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful tool for creating rich, interactive content. Start simple and gradually add more complex features as you become comfortable with the syntax.

Happy writing!
